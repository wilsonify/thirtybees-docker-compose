## Contributing

thirty bees modules are Open Source extensions to the thirty bees e-commerce solution. Everyone is welcome and even encouraged to contribute with their own improvements.

For details, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/thirtybees/thirtybees/blob/1.0.x/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the thirty bees core repository.

## Packaging

To build a package for the thirty bees distribution machinery or suitable for importing it into a shop, run `tools/buildmodule.sh` of the thirty bees core repository from inside the module root directory.

For module development, one clones this repository into `modules/` of the shop, alongside the other modules. It should work fine without packaging.

## Roadmap

#### Short Term

* None currently.

#### Long Term

* Merge with cheque module and custom payments module.
